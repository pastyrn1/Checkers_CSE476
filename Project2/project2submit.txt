Provide instructions on how to reach the first editing activity if the login button is not yet functional.

User account the server-side communications is running under: pastyrn1

Paths to all server-side scripts: (Such as https://www.cse.msu.edu/~carter/project2/login.php).
http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~pastyrn1/cse476/project2/create-player.php
http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~pastyrn1/cse476/project2/load-player.php

(Also http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~pastyrn1/cse476/project2/db.inc.php and the index.html)

Calls in the code to the server (provide a class name and function, or URL used for debugging):
createUser and checkExistence in Cloud.java, though both are currently commented out

Currently the login button showcases a failure (showing the toast) and the create user showcases a success (though neither are fully functional in the background).

Roles turned out somewhat different than described above, and can be seen more clearly in the repo history.
